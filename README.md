# *He is a real weasel*: Interpreting metaphors modified by modal stance adjectives and adverbs in English

Rating task part of a study by Doganc & Macuch-Silva. More information about the study can be found on the project page on the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/5v9xf/).

In this experiment we test the intensifying effect of the modal stance adverbs 'actually', 'literally' and 'really' when interpreting metaphors.
The experiment has a between-participants design with non-negated & negated lists. Each participant will see 26 statements in the form 'PRO is (ADV) a ANIMAL', 13 intensified and 13 non-intensified. Participants will rate the metaphoricity of each statement with a slider from 0(not meeting the characteristic of the mentioned animal at all) to 100(very much meeting the characteristic of the mentioned animal).
